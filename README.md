# Horiseon_Refactoring
Refactoring some HTML and CSS for Horiseon SEO 

Application for Horiseon SEO intended to act as a landing page that outlines what exactly they do to benefit businesses. 

Changes included:
- changing website name from 'website' to 'horiseon seo' ... for better seo / screenreader accessibility.
- organizing CSS and grouping redundant rulesets together to reduce bulk. 
- adding ALT tags to images for screen reader accessibility.
- making several div names more descriptive of their content / allow them to make more semantic sense to a screenreader. 
- relocating header image (digital-marketing-meeting.jpg) to link in the index HTML file rather than in the CSS.
- fixing a broken link (needed to be given an ID, not a class.)

Remaining to-do: 
- there were no rules written in the CSS for the class 'SEO'. Clarification on what the intended display was will be needed.
